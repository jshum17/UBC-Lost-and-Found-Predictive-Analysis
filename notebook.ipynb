    "Losing personal belongings is a common and often frustrating experience for students and staff at UBC. Items ranging from everyday essentials like wallets and keys to electronics and jewelry frequently end up in the lost and found. While the university maintains a central lost and found system, the lack of systematic analysis in these services can lead to inefficiencies, making it harder to identify trends and optimize recovery processes. By analyzing the UBC lost and found dataset, this project aims to uncover patterns in lost items, predict future trends, and provide actionable insights to enhance the efficiency of UBC's lost and found services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**: \n",
    "- **Item Classification Analysis**: Identify the most frequently lost item categories (e.g., electronics, wallets, keys).\n",
    "- **Temporal Analysis**: Examine seasonal and daily trends in lost item reports.\n",
    "- **Location Analysis**: Identify the most common campus locations where items are lost and found.\n",
    "- **Item Description Analysis**: Group similar items based on \"Item Description\" to identify detailed subcategories of lost items using NLP techniques\n",
    "- **Time Series Forecasting**: Develop predictive models to forecast the number of items reported to the lost and found using historical data.\n",
    "- **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations to improve the lost and found system, including targeted awareness campaigns, optimized item storage, and enhanced communication channels.\n"
